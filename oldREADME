doremi-script-clojure
=====================

Parser for doremi-script written in Clojure using instaparse - see http://github.com/rothfield/doremi-script-base

Status: Parser, semantic analyzer and  lilypond converter are done. Major missing piece is that octaves for ornaments are not implemented. 

[Integration test results](https://rawgithub.com/rothfield/doremi-script-clojure/master/test/test_results/report.html?https://raw.github.com/user/repo/master/)
