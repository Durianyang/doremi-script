<p>Notes by Laurie Lewis</p>
  <h3>Your Eyes </h3>
  <p>(Laurie Lewis/Spruce and Maple Music, ASCAP)
    <br />
Laurie- lead vocal, Tom, Scott- harmony vocals</p>
  <em>A sort-of Roger Miller-inspired number. I&rsquo;m always saying that music needs to make me either laugh or cry, and this one makes me laugh. Our friend, master mandolin builder, Stephen Gilchrist, said it sounded like &ldquo;Leonard Cohen Sings Bluegrass&rdquo;. I choose to take that as a compliment.</em><br />
<br />
Hey! What&rsquo;re you trying to do?<br />
Don&rsquo;t look at me when I&rsquo;m talking to you<br />
Turn away, close your eyes,<br />
Don your shades- don&rsquo;t you realize<br />
You can&rsquo;t look at me the way you do<br />
And not expect me to fall for you<br />
<br />
I was in the lead, but I stumbled at the rail<br />
I was flying high, but I&rsquo;m a kite with no tail<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna fall, and I was doing so well<br />
Until I looked into your eyes<br />
<br />
Hey! What&rsquo;re you trying to pull?<br />
They say the eyes are the gateway to the soul<br />
Posted signs mean nothing to you<br />
You just push that gate and you walk on through<br />
I guess you called this little girl&rsquo;s bluff,<br />
You know I&rsquo;m really not all that tough<br />
<br />
I was in the lead, but I stumbled at the rail<br />
I was flying high, but I&rsquo;m a kite with no tail<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna fall, and I was doing so well<br />
Until I looked into your eyes<br />
<br />
Nobody told me about your power<br />
To transform this hole into a field of flowers<br />
I&rsquo;m a deer in the headlights, totally absorbed<br />
By the brilliancy of your luminous orbs<br />
Take it from me, there&rsquo;s no disputin&rsquo;<br />
You&rsquo;re some kind of Svengali, or somethin&rsquo;<br />
<br />
I was in the lead, but I stumbled at the rail<br />
I was flying high, but I&rsquo;m a kite with no tail<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna fall, and I was doing so well<br />
Until I looked into your eyes<br />

<h3>Burley Coulter&rsquo;s Song For Kate Helen Branch</h3>
  <p> (Wendell Berry-lyrics [from Given: New Poems, published by Shoemaker and Hoard, &copy; 2005 by Wendell Berry], Laurie Lewis-music/Spruce and Maple Music, ASCAP)<br />
    Scott- vocal</p>
    <br />
    <em>Wendell Berry sent this poem to me and asked me to put it to music. It sat around for awhile, until I read his beautiful collection of stories,<strong> That Distant Land</strong>, and got to know some of the history of Burley and Kate Helen. Burley wasn&rsquo;t the sort of person to do the conventional thing, if it wasn&rsquo;t in his heart. He would disappear for days on end into the woods, knew how to work and knew how not to, and was always singing little snippets of songs. Kate Helen was the love of his life. I won&rsquo;t tell you any more than that. You&rsquo;ll have to read the book. Scott seems typecast to play the part of Burley.<b><br />
  </b></em><br />
    <img src="graphics/store/righthands2_med.jpg" alt="Laurie Lewis and the Right Hands CD - The Golden West" width="340" height="302" class="photo" />The rugs were rolled back to the walls<br />
    The band in place, the lamps all lit<br />
    We talked and laughed a little bit<br />
    And then obeyed the caller&rsquo;s call<br />
    - light-footed, happy, half-entranced-<br />
    To balance, swing and promenade<br />
    Do you remember how we danced, <br />
    And how the fiddler played<br />
    <br />
    About midnight we left the crowd<br />
    And wandered out to take a stroll<br />
    We heard the tree frog and the owl-<br />
    Beside the creek was running loud<br />
    The good dark held us as we chanced<br />
    The joy we two together made<br />
    Remembering how we whirled and pranced<br />
    And how the fiddler played<br />
    <br />
    That night is many years ago, and gone,<br />
    And still I see you clear-<br />
    Clear as the lamplight in your hair<br />
    The old time comes around me now<br />
    And I remember how you glanced at me<br />
    And how we stepped and swayed<br />
    I can&rsquo;t forget the way we danced<br />
    The way the fiddler played<br />
    Oh, how the fiddler played<br />
    <br />
  <h3>99 Year Blues</h3>
  <p>(Jimmie Rodgers, R. Hall/Peer International Corp./ASCAP)<br />
    Tom- vocal</p>
    <p><em>In the true spirit of Big Mon, Tom takes this old Jimmie Rodgers song and has his way with it. We never do find out what the protagonist is in for, but he doesn&rsquo;t deny the justice, just kvetches about the time. He must be a pretty bad guy.</em><br />
      <br />
      <img src="graphics/store/righthands3_med.jpg" alt="Laurie Lewis and the Right Hands CD - The Golden West" width="340" height="297" class="photo" />These 99 years ain't no fancy dream<br />
    If you had two lives to live,<br />
    you'd know just what I mean</p>
    <p> When the judge read the verdict, <br />
      it nearly knocked me down<br />
      He said, "Boy, you got two sixes, <br />
      but they're upside down<br />
      <br />
      When they carried me to the jail house, <br />
      I fell down across my bed<br />
      I couldn't keep from crying, <br />
      I wish to the lord I was dead<br />
      My good gal done told me <br />
      the day I hit this can<br />
      She said "you've made your bed in sorrow, <br />
      now sleep in it like a man."<br />
      <br />
      It ain't the days I've been here, <br />
      it's the days I gotta stay<br />
      All the old friends I ever had <br />
      done shook hands and gone away<br />
      All these old bootleggers, <br />
      they come here and done their time<br />
      And left me here a-grindin' <br />
      on the same old 99<br />
      <br />
      Well, 99 and 99 make 198<br />
      And that's more year's pretty mama, <br />
      than you can figure up on your slate<br />
      I don't know what else in the world to do<br />
      'Cause I lost everything except these 99 blues<br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>Before The Sun Goes Down</h3>
	<p>(Jimmy Martin, Harold Donny/Songs of Universal, inc.)<br />
    Laurie- lead vocal, Tom and Scott- harmony vocals</p>
   <p><em>This seems to be a song that every bluegrass enthusiast is familiar with, but almost no-one sings. Maybe it's too chauvinist for today's sensitive men of 'grass? I thank Craig for suggesting it for me. Here's to the King of Bluegrass! We miss him.</em><br />
   <br />
    Well, pack up your clothes, go on and leave<br />
    Tell your folks that we are through<br />
    Honey, that ain&rsquo;t a-gonna make me grieve <br />
&lsquo;cause I know just what you&rsquo;ll do<br />
You&rsquo;ll pout and cry and swear that I <br />
am the meanest thing in town<br />
But I&rsquo;ll bet money that you&rsquo;ll be back<br />
Before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Before the sun goes down, <br />
You&rsquo;ll be home ready for some lovin&rsquo;<br />
You&rsquo;ll run to your mama for some kissin&rsquo; and a-huggin&rsquo;<br />
And I&rsquo;ll be a-waitin&rsquo; around<br />
&lsquo;Cause I know you&rsquo;ll be home before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Honey, there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; else in the book <br />
That you ain&rsquo;t said to me<br />
All kinds of names and low-down things,<br />
I&rsquo;ve heard &lsquo;em all from A to Z<br />
And when you&rsquo;ve had your say, you&rsquo;ll up and run away<br />
And swear you&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; town<br />
But you&rsquo;ll come off it, come a-draggin&rsquo; it back<br />
Before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Before the sun goes down, <br />
You&rsquo;ll be home ready for some lovin&rsquo;<br />
You&rsquo;ll run to your mama for some kissin&rsquo; and a-huggin&rsquo;<br />
And I&rsquo;ll be a-waitin&rsquo; around<br />
&lsquo;Cause I know you&rsquo;ll be home before the sun goes down<br />
<br />
Before the sun goes down, <br />
You&rsquo;ll be home ready for some lovin&rsquo;<br />
You&rsquo;ll run to your mama for some kissin&rsquo; and a-huggin&rsquo;<br />
And I&rsquo;ll be a-waitin&rsquo; around<br />
&lsquo;Cause I know you&rsquo;ll be home before the sun goes down<br />
</p>
<h3>Live Forever</h3> 
<p>Forever (Billy Joe Shaver, E. Shaver/ Warner-Tamerlane Pub. Corp.; Eddy Shaver Publishing; Songs of Universal, inc./BMI)<br />
Scott- lead vocal, Laurie and Tom- harmony vocals</p>
<em>Scott&rsquo;s brother suggested this Americana classic as a good one for him to sing. He was right.</em><br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna live forever<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna cross that river<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna catch tomorrow now<br />
You&rsquo;re gonna want to hold me<br />
Just like I always told you<br />
You&rsquo;re gonna miss me when I&rsquo;m gone<br />
<br />
Nobody here will ever find me<br />
&lsquo;Though I will always be around<br />
Just like the songs I leave behind me<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna live forever now<br />
<br />
You fathers and you mothers<br />
Be good to one another<br />
Please try to raise your children right<br />
Don&rsquo;t let the darkness take &lsquo;em<br />
Don&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em feel forsaken<br />
Just lead them safely to the light<br />
<br />
If this old world is blown asunder<br />
And all the stars fall from the sky<br />
Remember someone really loves you<br />
We&rsquo;ll live forever, you and I<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna live forever<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna cross that river<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna catch tomorrow now <br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna live forever<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna cross that river<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna catch tomorrow now<br />
<br />
<h3>Rank Stranger</h3>
    <p>(Albert Brumley/Bridge Building Music/BMI)<br />
  Linda Ronstadt, Tom- harmony vocals</p>
   <p>   <em>I first sang this song with the Bluebirds, a vocal trio including Maria Muldaur and Linda Ronstadt, at the Wintergrass Festival in Tacoma, WA, in 2005. Linda had suggested it, saying she had always wanted to have a go at singing Ralph Stanley&rsquo;s blistering tenor. It was an unbelievable thrill to hear Linda come in on the chorus, busting loose with that Voice From The Radio. I am grateful that she wanted to join us on record.</em><br />
      <br />
      I wandered again to my home in the mountains<br />
      Where in youth&rsquo;s early dawn I was happy and free<br />
      I looked for my friends, but I never could find them<br />
      I found they were all rank strangers to me<br />
      <br />
      Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger<br />
      No mother nor dad, not a friend could I see<br />
      They knew not my name, and I knew not their faces<br />
      I found they were all rank strangers to me<br />
      <br />
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all moved away,&rdquo; said the voice of a stranger<br /> 
To a beautiful land by the bright crystal sea <br />
Some beautiful day, I&rsquo;ll meet them in Heaven <br />
Where no-one will be a rank stranger to me<br />
<br />
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger<br />
No mother nor dad, not a friend could I see<br />
They knew not my name, and I knew not their faces<br />
I found they were all rank strangers to me<br />
<br />
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger<br />
No mother nor dad, not a friend could I see<br />
They knew not my name, and I knew not their faces<br />
I found they were all rank strangers to me</p>
<br />
<h3>Bury Me In Bluegrass </h3>
<p>(Kate Campbell, Ira Campbell, Johnny Pierce/Cedarsong, Large River Music, Lehsem Songs, Music in Two/BMI)<br />
Tom- lead vocal, Laurie, Scott- harmony vocals</p>
<p><em>We send this song out to Stan Dickson of Louisville, who grew up on a farm 
outside of Lexington, Kentucky. On my guitar case, there's a bumper sticker he 
gave me that says &ldquo;Growth Destroys Bluegrass Forever&rdquo;. It's a delicate balance, 
for sure.<br />
</em><br />
Hughey was a captain with Andy Jackson<br />
Settled in Kentucky on a soldier&rsquo;s pay<br />
It was two hundred acres, and for almost as many years<br />
That land has borne my family&rsquo;s name<br />
You can count the generation like circles in a tree<br />
On tombstones you can barely read<br />
<br />
Will you walk with me across the blue-green pastures?<br />
I want to see the horses run one more time<br />
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me<br />
Bury me in bluegrass when I die<br />
<br />
Uncle Henry sells computers, he never learned to farm<br />
He sold his half to Daddy when Grandpa died<br />
Mom and Dad are old now, they say they&rsquo;re gonna move<br />
To where the weather is always warm and dry<br />
The buyer signed the note today, they&rsquo;re gonna build a mall<br />
With plans to break ground before the Fall<br />
<br />
Will you walk with me through the fields of burley?<br />
I want to see leaves of gold one more time<br />
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me<br />
Bury me in bluegrass when I die<br />
<br />
They nailed the sign up yesterday and I just don&rsquo;t understand<br />
To me it&rsquo;s more than just a piece of land<br />
<br />
Will you walk with me through the peaceful valley?<br />
I want to see the harvest moon one more time<br />
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me<br />
Bury me in bluegrass when I die</p>
<br />
<h3>The Golden West</h3>
<p>(instrumental)<br />
  (Bill Monroe)</p>
<em>Craig and I met at the Golden West Bluegrass Festival in Norco, CA, in the early 1970&rsquo;s. I like to imagine that Bill wrote this tune to commemorate that historic event. Seriously, though, the Father of Bluegrass music was always very proud of the fact that his Kentucky home-grown music had spread all over the world. He readily embraced players from California, Massachusetts, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, etc., always introducing them as being from &ldquo;The Great Bluegrass State of ________.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
<h3>A Hand To Hold</h3>
<p>(Laurie Lewis/Spruce and Maple Music, ASCAP)<br />
Laurie- lead vocal, Linda Ronstadt- harmony vocal</p>
<em>For my dear pal, Charles Sawtelle.</em><br />
<br />
The thrush in the forest, the lark in the field<br />
Sing like their lives depend on the song<br />
My mind has been full, but my voice has been still<br />
In all this time since you&rsquo;ve been gone<br />
<br />
&lsquo;Cause you and I, we shared a rocky road<br />
You and I shouldered a heavy load<br />
Ah, but you and I, we had something gold<br />
You and I, we had a hand to hold<br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s an empty room behind my heart&rsquo;s door<br />
And I&rsquo;ve tried to fill it by calling your name<br />
But the echoes subside and I know what&rsquo;s in store:<br />
Only the emptiness remains<br />
<br />
&lsquo;Cause you and I, we shared a rocky road<br />
You and I shouldered a heavy load<br />
Ah, but you and I, we had something gold<br />
You and I, we had a hand to hold<br />
<br />
I went out walking, thinking of you<br />
I was filled with self-pity that we had to part<br />
So I picked up a pebble of a pale rosy hue<br />
And I carried it next to my heart<br />
And it&rsquo;s strange, though I know that stone isn&rsquo;t you<br />
It&rsquo;s a talisman that I hold dear<br />
I clasp it tightly, and I don&rsquo;t feel so blue<br />
And somehow, it brings you near<br />
<br />
&lsquo;Cause you and I, we shared a rocky road<br />
You and I shouldered a heavy load<br />
Ah, but you and I, we had something gold<br />
You and I, we had a hand to hold<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>River Under The Road</h3>
<p>(Ana Egge, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Sarah Brown/ Irving Music, inc.; Jade Eg Music; Two Bagger Music; Lew Bob Songs/BMI)<br />
Tom- lead vocal, Laurie- harmony vocal</p>
<em>We&rsquo;ve loved this song ever since 
we first heard Ana Egge sing it a decade ago.</em> <br />
<br />
I dreamed of water running under my wheels<br />
The kind of dream you remember just how it feels<br />
I wondered what it was meant to be<br />
until I saw what was sent to me<br />
<br />
I found a river under the road<br />
Been there forever but I'd never been told<br />
It goes much farther, deeper and darker<br />
Than the road above will ever go<br />
<br />
The river whispered so softly, so sure and so deep<br />
You'll travel farther cradled, covered, asleep<br />
And when your dreams trade the day for night<br />
The river's tears turn the darkness to light<br />
<br />
I found a river under the road<br />
Been there forever but I'd never been told<br />
It goes much farther, deeper and darker<br />
Than the road above will ever go<br />
<br />
Moonlight shining on shades of green and black<br />
I heard the water and the pavement began to crack<br />
Dream river singing that highway sound<br />
I watched the blacktop tumbling down<br />
<br />
I found a river under the road<br />
Been there forever but I'd never been told<br />
It goes much farther, deeper and darker<br />
Than the road above will ever go<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Hard Luck In Heaven</h3>
<p>(Scott Huffman/Spruce and Maple Music/ASCAP)<br />
Scott- lead vocal, Laurie, Tom- harmony vocals</p>
<em>What if our "pie in the sky" is burnt?</em><br />
<br />
While on this old Earth, Lord, I&rsquo;ve suffered, I&rsquo;ve cried<br />
Things don&rsquo;t work out, Lord, as hard as I've tried <br />
I&rsquo;ll have up in Glory a crown for my prize<br />
But knowin&rsquo; my luck, Lord, it&rsquo;ll be the wrong size<br />
<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t so<br />
&lsquo;Cause down here on Earth Lord, it&rsquo;s all that I know<br />
When I&rsquo;m in my mansion, will the roof leak there too?<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t true<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ve always been hard luck, it&rsquo;s always been true<br />
So I&rsquo;m not expecting any different from you<br />
When I get my wings, Lord, they won&rsquo;t fit me right<br />
I&rsquo;ll be flappin&rsquo; in circles o&rsquo;er the City of Light<br />
<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t so<br />
&lsquo;Cause down here on Earth Lord, it&rsquo;s all that I know<br />
When I&rsquo;m in my mansion, will the roof leak there too?<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t true<br />
<br />
Now, Lord, please forgive me for thinkin&rsquo; this way<br />
But hard times just haunt me each night and all day<br />
When the angels start singin&rsquo; and they pass out the harps<br />
Knowin&rsquo; my luck, Lord, mine&rsquo;ll be tuned too sharp<br />
<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t so<br />
&lsquo;Cause down here on Earth Lord, it&rsquo;s all that I know<br />
When I&rsquo;m in my mansion, will the roof leak there too?<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t true<br />
Hard luck in Heaven, please say it ain&rsquo;t true<br />
<br /><br />
<h3>The Mourning Cloak</h3>
<p> (Karah Stokes/Spruce and Maple Music)<br />
Laurie- vocal</p>
<em>This is a song about love, betrayal, murder, and butterflies. Hearing it for the first time sent me to the dictionary to look up &ldquo;mourning cloak,&rdquo; which is, indeed, a butterfly. Since then, I have seen them everywhere, especially in August on the banks of the Tuolumne River in California, with their dusty black wings &ldquo;bound in gold and sapphires rare.&rdquo; Scott says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like a good killin&rsquo; song.&rdquo;</em><b><br />
</b><br />
One fair morning late in June<br />
The sun shone on the daisies white<br />
When a messenger of sorrow deep<br />
Came into my garden bright<br />
<br />
Wings of deepest velvet black<br />
Bound with gold and sapphires rare<br />
A butterfly, a Mourning Cloak,<br />
Like one a wealthy widow&rsquo;d wear<br />
<br />
He promised me a golden ring<br />
But he gave it to a rich man&rsquo;s child<br />
He craved the ease wealth would bring<br />
Above a love both true and wild<br />
<br />
So I called him to our trysting place<br />
&ldquo;Since there&rsquo;s no help, let&rsquo;s kiss and part&rdquo;<br />
He took me in a sweet embrace<br />
And he felt a penknife in his heart<br />
<br />
He looked at me with fading eyes<br />
I left him there as he left me<br />
The dawn next morning brought the news<br />
That he&rsquo;d been set upon by thieves<br />
<br />
Oh, butterfly, why do you haunt?<br />
Know you the secret in my breast?<br />
I pierced his heart as he pierced mine<br />
I slew the one I loved the best<br />
<br />
One fair morning late in June<br />
The sun shone on the daisies white<br />
When a messenger of sorrow deep<br />
Came into my garden bright<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Goodbye Waltz</h3>
<p>(John Hartford/ John Hartford Music/BMI)</p>
<p><em>Tom and I worked up this song when we were asked to take part in a memorial riverboat cruise for John on the Ohio River a few years back. It's a song that just got under our skin, and we have been singing it ever since.</em><br />
    <br />
  See that boat go down the sky<br />
  Goodbye, goodbye<br />
  See that boat go down the sky<br />
  Goodbye, goodbye<br />
  See that boat go down the sky<br />
  Till it's just a speck at the edge of my eye<br />
  It is so hard to say goodbye <br />
  Goodbye<br />
  <br />
  See that boat go down the sky<br />
  Goodbye, goodbye<br />
  See that boat go down the sky<br />
  Goodbye, goodbye<br />
  See that boat go down the sky<br />
  Till the shades of night are drawing nigh<br />
  And the wind dies out in the western sky<br />
  Goodbye<br />
  <em><br />
  <br />
  For three days in July of 2005, we five lived together in the guest house at Sage Arts Studio outside Arlington, WA and recorded these songs. </em></p>
<p><em>We had intended to be more prepared when we got there, but life in the twenty-first century being what it is, we just showed up with a general idea of what songs we could do and no arrangements to speak of. </em></p>
<p><em>Over the course of the three days, we played, recorded, cooked and ate together, walked in the woods, stared at the nearby Stillaguamish River, and played some more. Everything seemed so fresh and enticing to us, hearing and playing the majority of these tunes for the first time as a group. </em></p>
<p><em>When we left, we could barely remember what we&rsquo;d done on that first day, and a very busy touring schedule for the remainder of the season made it so that we couldn&rsquo;t get back to really listening and putting the finishing touches on the tracks until the following spring. By then, it was like opening a bunch of presents. Everything was a treat to the ears. </em></p>
<p><em>When I played the roughs for Linda Ronstadt, she was so taken with &ldquo;A Hand to Hold,&rdquo; that she asked if she could sing harmony on it. Of course, I said yes. She came over to Berkeley one day and laid down her harmony parts at my house. </em></p>
<p><em>Craig and Scott make their homes in North Carolina, and Tom, Todd and I live in California. For Craig, Todd and me, that&rsquo;s where we were born and raised. Tom originally hails from the great bluegrass state of Connecticut, but has now lived in the Golden West longer than he&rsquo;s lived anywhere else. Scott, on the other hand, is a Tarheel born and bred. I thank the combination of luck and circumstance that has brought us all together. </em></p>
 <p> ~ Laurie Lewis </p>
 <p>PS: The cover photos were taken at Mortar Rock Park, very close to where I grew up here in Berkeley.</p>
