<srruby> I understand that I use maven like RubyGems to install and manage Java components.  There seems to be a Maven repository at  mvnrepository.com  where I can pull in jar files. How does this all fit in with leiningen ?
<joegallo> srruby: what dependency do you want to pull in?
<joegallo> that is, give me one example, please
<gtrak> srruby: lein uses maven repos (remote and local) for its artifacts.  The particular repos used are specific to a project, but a few are included by default.
<srruby> joegallo: Texhyphj 
<srruby> joegallo: It is on http://mvnrepository.com
<joegallo> srruby: i searched mavenrepository for it, and found this http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.googlecode.texhyphj|texhyphj|1.2|bundle
<srruby> joegallo: Right. Now how do I integrate it with Clojure/Leiningen
<joegallo> so you would put [com.googlecode.texhyphj/texhyphj "1.2"] in your project.clj file under :dependencies
<joegallo> and then run lein deps
<srruby> cool
<joegallo> and it'll download it
<srruby> joegallo: Thanks very much!
<joegallo> you're welcome
<zerokarmaleft> srruby: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/sample.project.clj#L39
<zerokarmaleft> the sample project is well-commented, and it's worth scanning the whole thing just to see what options are available
