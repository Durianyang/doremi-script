  ;; Lilypond text for line break.
  ;; Lilypond doesn't like  left-repeat break barline
  ;; That is why I insert an invisible grace note spacer after the
  ;; break. Otherwise lilypond will combine the left-repeat and barline
  ;; and you lose the left repeat.
  ;; Probably better to examine bars at end of line and beginning of next
  ;; line and combine them into one.
