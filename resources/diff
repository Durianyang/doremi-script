+TODO:
+note that there is controversy over whether something is a chord or an
+ornament! for now i've put ornaments before chords. perhaps we should have
+an ornament-or-chord item and let the semantic analyzer distinguish them.
+the semantic analyzer can decide whether something is an ornament or not
+by looking at the column.
+since ornaments are either before or after a note according to the current
+scheme, there should be little overlap!!
+another idea is to tag the lines as follows:
+
+chords:
+ornaments:
+tala:
+
+but that seems ugly
+
+another idea is to have a
+chord-upper-line = 3 or more chords ??? that could disambiguate it.
+
+another idea is to use [chord-symbol] vs <ornament> to disambiguate the 2.
